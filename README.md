# Cryptocurrencies

###Description

In this challenge we are tasked with using unsupervised machine learning to create a report that classifies cryptocurrencies that are being traded in the market in groups that can be marketed as new investment oportunities to clients.

### *Deliverable #1*

 - Keep all the cryptocurrencies that are being traded.
 - Drop the IsTrading column.
 - Remove rows that have at least one null value.
 - Filter the crypto_df DataFrame so it only has rows where coins have been mined.
 - Create a new DataFrame that holds only the cryptocurrency names, and use the crypto_df DataFrame index as the index for this new DataFrame.
 - Remove the CoinName column from the crypto_df DataFrame since it's not going to be used on the clustering algorithm.

### *Deliverable #2* 

 - The PCA algorithm reduces the dimensions of the X DataFrame down to three principal components (10 pt)
 - The pcs_df DataFrame is created and has the following three columns, PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3, and has the index from the crypto_df DataFrame (10 pt)

### *Deliverable #3*

 - The K-means algorithm is used to cluster the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data, where the following steps have been completed:
 - An elbow curve is created using hvPlot to find the best value for K (10 pt)
 - Predictions are made on the K clusters of the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data (5 pt)
 - A new DataFrame is created with the same index as the crypto_df DataFrame and has the following columns: Algorithm, ProofType, TotalCoinsMined, TotalCoinSupply, PC    1, PC 2, PC 3, CoinName, and Class (5 pt)
